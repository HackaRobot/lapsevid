# The following variable makes the rover turn left or right.
# A -ve number makes it turn left. A positive number turns it to the right.
# A value of 0 makes it move forward with no intentional turn.

# 5 means every fifth move will be a right turn, all others will be a 
# move forward.
# Use lower numbers for tighter turns.
